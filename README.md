# AWS-SERVERLESS-DEPLOYMENT

🧩 Project Overview:

 Implemented and deployed a fully serverless infrastructure on AWS to host and run a student data management system that helps to store and list student data with dynamic frontend-backend interaction.
 
🔹 Frontend: Static website (HTML + JavaScript) hosted on Amazon S3

🔹 Backend Services:
 1. API Gateway to expose secure REST endpoints.
 2. AWS Lambda functions to handle GET and POST logic.
 3. DynamoDB to store and retrieve student data.
