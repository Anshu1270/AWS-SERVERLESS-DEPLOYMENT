# AWS-SERVERLESS-DEPLOYMENT

🧩 Project Overview:

 Implemented and deployed a fully serverless infrastructure on AWS to host and run a student data management system that helps to store and list student data with dynamic frontend-backend interaction.
🔹 Frontend: Static website (HTML + JavaScript) hosted on Amazon S3
🔹 Backend Services:
 1. API Gateway to expose secure REST endpoints.
 2. AWS Lambda functions to handle GET and POST logic.
 3. DynamoDB to store and retrieve student data.

✅ Outcome:

 🔹Successfully deployed a real-world application on AWS using only managed services
 🔹Configured IAM roles, API Gateway resources, and CORS settings
 🔹Ensured smooth communication between frontend and backend components in a secure and scalable manner.

🚀 What I Achieved:

🔹Strengthened my understanding of cloud-native deployments and serverless workflows.
🔹Improved my practical skills in using AWS core services in a real deployment scenario.
🔹Built confidence to handle real-world cloud projects from an infrastructure and DevOps perspective.

📌 Always excited to learn, build, and optimize cloud solutions.
